first use server.js to generate keypoints. just need to replace img.src
then manually copy paste keypoints into canvas.html according to comments ie: left hip to left knee

uncomment this in canvas.html to have skeleton overlaid on top of image
// var img = document.getElementById("scream");
// ctx.drawImage(img, 10, 10);

also in canvas.html, adjust the height and width of the canvas according to the yellow numbers printed out by server.js
